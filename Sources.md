## Feynman Lectures

The Feynman Lectures are great for any physicist that has completed their first or second year of introductory physics. Feynman even states the purpose of his lectures began to change over the course when he began to gave it; many graduate students and professors began to drop into his lectures. Another note many forget is that students who are new to S.T.E.M./scienctific thinking in general would not be prepared to read and/or review the material that Feynman covers; his audience were well prepared students that were able to gain admission into one of the top schools in the country. Many of these students were already well prepared for first year courses, and this material as presented would be review. 

Many confuse the purpose of the Feynman Lectures. For some they are a great intro as they have had the neccesary exposure beforehand. New students to the field would be quicky confused by the Feynman Lectures, and students who have already had a course in introductory physics would find these lectures to be a great review and/or a great source to hammer down the fundemantals. 

Issac Asimov's Understanding Physics would be a great alternative. 

## [How to become a GOOD Theoretical Physicist](https://goodtheorist.science/index.html)

"This is a web site (under construction) for young students"

A sentence that has remained on this website since I was I beginning high school; nearly 10 years ago at this point. I have not seen a single source, section or anything of the sort been added since my formative years. The listed caretaker of the website seems to have moved on from Gerard T'Hoofts group. 

# Common Sources I see around

[Susan J. Fowler / Susan Rigetti](https://www.susanrigetti.com/physics)

I've seen this site be recommended along with Gerard T'Hoofts webiste. Though I hold that Dr. T'Hoofts website is no longer is helpful. Fowlers/Rigettis site is quite helpful, and has the same recommendations that most of the projects publications have. The only critique that I have with their website would be the intro pop-science books posted at the beginning of the website. I would recommend their wesbite for some supplementary sources.
