# Waves and Oscialltions

###### Preliminary
  This subsection will be quite small, due to two reasons; The course isn't taught at many schools, rather the course is wrapped up as a section in their Quantum Mechanics course, their Modern Physics course, Electrodynamics, or Classical Mechanics. Different Colleges and Universities teach their courses differently, so this subsection is to appease the general audience who have a separate course for Waves and Oscillations (or Vibrations). Users who do not, may continue onto the next physics Bibliography.

A vast majority of US universities (that I'm aware of) no longer have full courses on Waves and Oscillations, the one's I'm aware that have name power of are Cornell and MIT. Most other institutions wrap it up in either Modern Physics or Quantum Mechanics. 

For the sake of my recommendations, I'll assume you're a U.S. undergraduate either in their 2nd or 3rd year taking a full  Waves and Oscillations course.

###### Pre-Requisites
* [Electrostatics \& Electromagnetism](https://old.reddit.com/r/bibliographies/comments/ajm6ex/physics/)

* [Multi-variable Calculus](https://old.reddit.com/r/bibliographies/comments/ak9let/multivariable_calculus/)

* [Ordinary Differential Equations](https://old.reddit.com/r/bibliographies/comments/akgt8r/differential_equations/)

* [Partial Differential Equations](https://old.reddit.com/r/bibliographies/comments/akgtbv/partial_differential_equations/)


###### Books

 * [R.A. Waldron - Waves and Oscillations](https://archive.org/details/WavesOscillations/page/n67/mode/2up) - Archive link. As far as I'm aware it's a fairly conceptual book (only ~ 60 pages) but derives topics in W&O using PDE's and such. Seems like a decent book, and I've seen it recommend across a few forums and a quick scan seems like it does the job. Chapter 6 does seem outdated though (Network Theory) will need someone else to a-okay the outdateness as well. 

 * [David Morin - Waves and Oscillations Draft](https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/david-morin/files/waves_oscillations.pdf) - Harvard Scholar link, from the same Morin that has a Classical Mechanics Book out with Thompson. It's in draft format from a new book that he's writing. I haven't seen many PDE's rather n-th order Linear ODE's

 * [A.P French - Vibrations and Waves](https://www.amazon.com/Vibrations-Waves-P-French/dp/8123909144) - MIT's book on said topic used in their version of the class at MIT, and possibly on OCW (will have to check on that). I'd imagine it's good enough, as it is used at MIT. Haven't done much checking on this book, but I recall his Introductory Physics book was pretty solid in any case.  

 * [Howard Geogri - The Physics of Waves](https://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~hgeorgi/onenew.pdf) - This is like a "textbook" textbook. Has a complete chapter on symmetries of physics.

 * [ M.I Rabinovich and D.I Trubetskov -  Oscillations and Waves: in Linear and Nonlinear Systems](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0792304454) - Russian/Soviet Era Textbook that *will* kick your ass. Has applications towards hydrodynamics and stochastic oscillations, in reference towards nonlinear oscillations and waves.
