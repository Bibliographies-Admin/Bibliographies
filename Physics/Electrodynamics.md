# Electrodynamics

Electrodynamics (or "Electricity and Magnetism", as it is sometimes called in introductory courses) is the study of the interaction between matter with electric charge and the electric and magnetic fields.  Electric charges create these fields and also experience forces in their presence, and electrodynamics seeks to understand the mathematical laws governing this relationship.

**Prerequisites:**

Before studying electrodynamics in depth, readers should have completed a study of general physics by working through an university-level introductory text.  Readers should also have completed a classical mechanics text, but this is not necessarily required; these two subtopics can be studied in parallel.  Elementary calculus is required, and readers should also be familiar with vectors.  Understanding vector and multivariable calculus is also recommended.

* [Multivariable Calculus]()

* [Vector Calculus] *No technical bib on this, math methods and most Multivariable textbooks will teach this*

* [Ordinary Differential Equations]() *Grad Level*

* [Partial Differential Equations]()*Grad Level*

**Where to Start:**

Just as with general physics, readers who wish to study electrodynamics should begin by picking up an introductory textbook.  This textbook should be read diligently, chapter-by-chapter, and readers should complete as many of the problems given at the end of each section as possible.  Reading through the textbook will not suffice - readers will discover that they don't really understand the concepts until they've wrestled with a few tough problems. For those who are new to electrodynamics, having only worked through university-level general physics, the recommended textbook is Griffiths.

Eventually, readers will learn that the electric and magnetic fields are two aspects of the same field and that propagating electromagnetic fields (a.k.a light) travel at the same constant speed in all cases - even from the perspectives of two people moving at different velocities!  Reconciling this strange fact with our ordinary notions of classical mechanics led to the theory of special relativity published by Einstein in 1905.  Classical mechanics and electrodynamics form the foundation of a good physics education, so after completing electrodynamics, readers will be ready to study relativity, quantum mechanics, or any other advanced subtopic.  But it is very important to study differential equations, linear algebra, and other mathematical methods in parallel with physics, since these become increasingly crucial as you move into more modern, advanced fields.

**Books:**

###### Undergraduate Books

 * [Griffiths, David J.  **Introduction to Electrodynamics**.  Addison-Wesley: 2012, 4th ed.](http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Electrodynamics-4th-David-Griffiths/dp/0321856562) *Undergraduate-level introductory text, Griffiths is commonly used across most Universities at the current moment. Loved by most, hated by the vocal minority; it's the best undergraduate Electrodynamics book that you can get*

 * [Electricity and Magnetism 3rd Edition by Edward M. Purcell (Author), David J. Morin (Author)](https://archive.org/details/ElectricityAndMagnetismPurcell_201701/page/n423/mode/2up) *Written by Nobel Laureate and generally regarded to be chock full of theory, though it is a couple of decades old, so you'll find assumptions and experimental evidence to be quite indicative of the era it was written in*

###### Graduate Books


 * [Jackson, John David.  **Classical Electrodynamics**.  Wiley: 1998, 3rd ed.](http://www.amazon.com/Classical-Electrodynamics-Third-David-Jackson/dp/047130932X) *The standard yet somewhat-controversial graduate-level introductory textbook, this book is extremely comprehensive, with very challenging, sometimes overly-technical problems to work - it may not be the best choice for self-study, but few good alternatives exist*

 * [Landau, L.D. **The Classical Theory of Fields**. Butterworth-Heinemann: 1980, 4th ed.](http://www.amazon.com/Classical-Theory-Fields-Fourth-Theoretical/dp/0750627689) *An outstanding supplement to a graduate-level textbook - approaches the theory from the basic ideas about electromagnetic fields rather than building up from electrostatics, also discusses gravitational fields (general relativity)). Same Level as Jackson*

 * [Panofsky, Wolfgang K.H. and Phillips, Melba. **Classical Electricity and Magnetism**. Dover Publications: 2005, 2nd ed.](http://www.amazon.com/Classical-Electricity-Magnetism-Second-Physics/dp/0486439240) *An alternative graduate-level introductory textbook, not as thorough as Jackson but also not as hard on readers - and it's a much cheaper Dover book*

 * [Static and Dynamic Electricity by William R. Smythe (Author)](https://archive.org/details/StaticAndDynamicElectricity/page/n5/mode/2up) *Thought Jackson was easy? Are you a massive masochist? Former reference for the field in the 20th century, Smythes' course caused Nobel Laureate Vernon Smith to switch majors*
