# Special relativity

"Special Relativity is the generally accepted and experimentally confirmed physical theory regarding the relationship between space and time."

**Prerequisites:**

Depending on the book:

- [Multivariable Calculus](https://www.reddit.com/r/bibliographies/comments/ak9let/multivariable_calculus/)

- [Linear Algebra](https://old.reddit.com/r/bibliographies/comments/akgoky/linear_algebra/)

**Books**

* [Special Relativity (M.I.T. Introductory Physics) First Edition
by A.P. French](https://www.amazon.com/Special-Relativity-M-I-T-Introductory-Physics/dp/0393097935)

* [Special Relativity First Edition by Robert Resnick](https://www.amazon.com/Special-Relativity-P-Robert-Resnick/dp/0471717258)

* [The Meaning of Relativity by Albert Einstein](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/36276/36276-pdf.pdf) *Helps make a connection between Special Relativity and General Relativity. A "mathy" introduction to Special Relativity compared to most books, requires a good grasp on Calculus and possibly of Linear Algebra*

* [SPECIAL RELATIVITY AND ITS EXPERIMENTAL FOUNDATION (Advanced Theoretical Physical Science)
by Yuan Zhong Zhang](https://www.amazon.com/RELATIVITY-EXPERIMENTAL-FOUNDATION-Advanced-Theoretical/dp/9810227493) *An interesting read if you need to know the experimental basis of Special Relativity*
