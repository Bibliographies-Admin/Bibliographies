# Statistical Mechanics

**Description:**

"Statistical mechanics is one of the pillars of modern physics. It is necessary for the fundamental study of any physical system that has many degrees of freedom. The approach is based on statistical methods, probability theory and the microscopic physical laws. It can be used to explain the thermodynamic behavior of large systems." -Wikipedia


**Preliminary:**

I do want to say before a user starts this Bibliography, that this was one of the most difficult Bibs I've had to make in regards to the textbooks. For some reason, the textbooks pertaining to this field aren't highly regarded, nor are they usually well written. I have a hard time recommending any undergraduate textbook for Stat Mech or Thermodynamics:

* Kittel & Kroemer hasn't been updated in over 40 years and the publishers are still asking nearly $150 for the book (at the time this bib was published). It is usually recommended in lieu of Schroeder.

* Schroeder is typically used for intro Statistical Mechanics, and in most forums, is usually disliked, wherein most users refer to Kittel & Kroemer as their preferred textbook. This begins a cycle where one users hates Kittel & Kroemer and recommends Schroeder, another user comes in and recommends Kittel & Kroemer and thus continues the cycle.

* Reif is known for it's usage for obscure notation, unnecessarily formality, and clarity issues. Some users state it is the best book, while others want to burn it in a fire.

* Herbert B. Callen: Published and not revised since 1985. "In the preface to this second edition, Callen described his 25-year-old postulatory approach to thermodynamics and statistical mechanics as "now widely accepted".  In fact, by the time of his second edition, his approach was completely outdated, because it springs from nineteenth-century ideas of thermodynamics in which concepts such as entropy were not understood.  This means that Callen simply postulated the core quantities such as entropy and temperature with essentially no context, and without providing any physical insight or analysis.  It might all look streamlined, but his approach will give you no insight into the difficult and interesting questions of the subject.  Callen described his approach as rendering the subject transparent and simple; but his approach comes across as obscure.  For example, in the early part of the book, he insists on repeatedly writing "1/T1 = 1/T2" for two temperatures that are ascertained to be equal, when anyone else would write "T1 = T2".  And, for what he does write, the devil is often in the details that he tends to leave out.  Even at the start, when Callen introduces the concept of work, he fails to say whether he is talking about the work done on the system, or by the system, leaving the reader to work that out for himself from some irrelevant comments about the mechanical work term −P dV.  Callen's incorrect renditions of the Taylor expansion in an appendix seem to suggest, rather oddly, that he didn't understand the difference between "dx" and "Δx".  His book includes a 20-page postscript in which he makes claims about the role of symmetry in thermodynamics; but, as far as I can tell, this section says nothing useful at all.  I suspect that the reason this book is as frequently cited as it is said to be lies in its being used as the basis for a course by many lecturers who never learned the subject themselves, and hence don't reseal that the book's approach is outdated.  If you really want to learn the subject, use the modern statistical approach, in which entropy is defined to relate to numbers of configurations.  As far as readability goes, Callen's writing tends to omit commas; but this can make his sentences tedious to read, since the reader ends up having to make two or three passes to decode what some sentences are saying.  (If you use few commas yourself, study a typical sentence in Callen's book: "the intermediate states of the gas are non equilibrium states for which the enthalpy is not defined".  Callen is not singling out a special set of non-equilibrium states here; instead, enthalpy is not defined for any non-equilibrium state.  He should have included a single comma, by writing "the intermediate states of the gas are non-equilibrium states, for which the enthalpy is not defined".)

###### Undergraduate Books

 * [Thermal Physics (2nd Edition) Second Edition by Charles Kittel (Author), Herbert Kroemer (Author)](https://www.amazon.com/Thermal-Physics-2nd-Charles-Kittel/dp/0716710889) *Not a bad a book but considering that most Statistical Mechanics aren't very well written, it stands out from the few decent books*

 * [Introduction to Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics 2nd Edition by Keith Stowe (Author)](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Thermodynamics-Statistical-Mechanics/dp/1107694922) *A very good book that has plenty of good explanations. Mathematics is a little less than what you would hope for, as some explanations and crucial calculations are left to the appendix. A more modern and meaningful approach to Stat Mech than most books*

 * [An Introduction to Thermal Physics 1st Edition by Daniel V. Schroeder (Author)](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Thermal-Physics-Daniel-Schroeder/dp/0201380277/ref=sr_1_2?crid=W589GKLQOEMF&dchild=1&keywords=schroeder+thermal+physics&qid=1586189231&s=books&sprefix=Schroeder+%2Cstripbooks%2C158&sr=1-2) *The replacement textbook from Kittel & Kroemer commonly used in most Universities.*
