* Download [VS CODE](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
 * Go to the bottom left of the VSCode application, to the Accounts Icon. Sign into Settings Sync using GitHub account.
* Download [Markdown All in One](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzhang.markdown-all-in-one) and [Markdown Preview Enhanced](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=shd101wyy.markdown-preview-enhanced) ***AFTER*** downloading VS Code. 
* Download GitHub Desktop
 * Sign in using GitHub Account
* Go to clone Repository by URL.

 * OR IF POSSIBLE, just clone any available repository you have, ***AND CHANGE INTO THE STAGING-CHANGES BRANCH***
 * Clone the Repository to your machine.

You should download GitHub Desktop/VS Code

Check to see if you see my projects in this page: https://github.com/BibliographiesProject/Bibliographies/projects. If not don't worry about it. If you do, please change each note to the respective column while you're working. Easier for both you and I. 

Have this webiste open all the time: https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax. This is the "language" you will be writing in all the time. Follow my format if you ever have trouble. 


## GitHub Desktop/VS Code/AutoSave

When you make your github account send me the email or username and I'll add you as a collaborator. The invite will come through email. When you accept follow the next steps.

The steps below are very helpful when you're editing but are NOT necessary. Everything can be done on the website, but your changes will have to be manually saved and won't be automatically saved. I recommend this guide instead of the one that follows this. 

Open github desktop and sign in with your account. Two things might happen, it'll ask you to clone the bibliographies repo and you should select confirm and make sure that you know where it's downloaded to (just keep it default). 

If that doesn't happen go back to github website and you should see the entire GitHub repo (it should have folders and a little read-me at the bottom, look at the middle left of the page and it should say "master" with a little branch on the side and a drop down box. Go all the way to the green button and click "open in GitHub desktop". The project should now open in GitHub desktop and you shouldn't have to worry. 

On GitHub desktop there should be a little prompt that in the middle of your screen that says "Open the repository in your external editor, select your editor in options". Click options and make the default VS Code. You should be able to open VS Code and the entire project should be open on the side. You should be done here, but if you want to continue without me you're more than welcome to, you can't screw anything up here. 

VS Code is where you can make really easy changes. You save, and then go over to GitHub Desktop and be able to push or pull changes to the github repo on the website. If you change it on your computer and push it will change on the repo wesbite. Save the file with .md extension as you're working with markdown. If you go in vscode and click the cubes on the side panel, and type in save typing, you can download that extension
and it will save while you're typing. Once you are done, and everything is saved and you double checked everthing you will go to Github Desktop and will change your branch from master to "Staging changes",. It will say you have new commits to push to the origin, and you should push to "Staging changes", and leave a summary and description of what you did (a small sentence is fine, nothing more needed). Continue to work and if you have any questions just ping me. The second guide here will negate all of this and will be simpler, but might screw you over

## Only GitHub

Okay, instead of all that, you can just edit the pages directly on GitHub with your account. No need to sync changes or anything and you just work on the "staging changes" branch. None of your work will save unless you manually save, and you can't review what you changed unlike github desktop. The experience is a lot worse and if you forgot what you just did you might have to start all over.

## Things you have to do

Make sure you are doing work in the "Staging Changes" branch and not the master branch. 

Check ever document in every folder for the following things:

* Remove every single reddit link and replace it with a GitHub Link. See the [Classical Mechanics Document](https://github.com/BibliographiesProject/Bibliographies/blob/master/Science/Physical%20Sciences/Physics/Classical%20Mechanics.md). In the pre-requisites, it links to the reddit page. You *have* to remove this and replace it with a link from the ***GitHub Repo MASTER Branch***. You do not have to comment that you replaced this link.  Edit this document to see the link above for classical mechanics. It is from the file from the Master Branch. Do NOT copy the link from your "Staging Changes" branch. It will not exist after you are done with your work. 

* Make sure the amazon link is still up. If not, you'll have to find the book I linked and find a new webpage for it that you believe won't go down. (Amazon is a good example, or the publishers website).
 * Scroll down and find the ISBN-13 number, it should look something like this:  ISBN-13 ‏ : ‎ 978-1108420419. Go down below the amazon link in the document, and press the space bar, the asterisk symbol (*) and then copy and paste the ISBN-13 number like this,  ISBN-13 ‏ : ‎ 978-1108420419. The number should be indented. [See here for example](https://github.com/BibliographiesProject/Bibliographies/blob/master/Math/DiscreteMathematics.md)

 * IF there is a new version of the book, copy and paste the new link into the document. Change out either the year or edition if you do if I made note of it

* Make sure every link is avilable and able to be reached on your ***non-vpn*** connection. If it isn't (404 error, webpage no longer exists) copy and paste the link ***at the bottom of the document***, and put it in a comment like so. Each comment needs a space before and after it. Edit this document to see what I'm talking about. 

[//]: # (Your Removed Link and Description go in these parantheses - Then say what kind of link it was, Book, Article, Pre-amble etc.)

[//]: # (Your Removed Link and Description go in these parantheses - Then say what kind of link it was, Book, Article, Pre-amble etc. - This is the proper spacing)

Here's an example:


[//]: # (Taylor, John R. **Classical Mechanics** University Science Books: 2005. http://www.amazon.com/Classical-Mechanics-John-R-Taylor/dp/189138922X - Undergraduate Book)

This will not be commented out, and will be visible in the document. Make sure something like this doesn't happen:

[//]: # ([Taylor, John R. **Classical Mechanics** University Science Books: 2005.](http://www.amazon.com/Classical-Mechanics-John-R-Taylor/dp/189138922X)- Undergraduate Book)

* IF the link is reachable go to this website, [https://archive.org/web/](https://archive.org/web/). Put in your link, and save it. Come back to the document and replace that link. Please make sure the webpage properly loads. If it's a book that is linked, please make sure the pdf loads in the archive link or is able to be downloaded. Try youtube links if they work. If they don't, don't worry about them.

Next is the easier part. 

Go to the [wiki](https://github.com/BibliographiesProject/Bibliographies/wiki/Directory), and begin to replace all the hyperlinks with links from the ***MASTER BRANCH DOCUMENTS***. This is how I found out that there are different versions. This is a copy paste job. Use the list of modules.md file in order to store the Master File Links, and be able to quickly copy and paste these links. 

You need to repeat this process for the files in the physics folder/Physics plans and guides. There are two files that this needs to be done for, physics with AND without preperation. 

Once you're done, let me know and I'll review all your changes before pushing them to the master.
