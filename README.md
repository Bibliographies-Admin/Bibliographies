# The Bibliographies Project

Hello! Welcome to the Repository for the Bibliographies Project!

This project is designed for creating in-depth and quality assured documents, publications and helpful guides for any person interested in learning academic disciplines, or attempting an academic degree. 

If you've ever visited Gerard T'Hoofts [How to become a a GOOD Theoretical Physicist](https://webspace.science.uu.nl/~gadda001/goodtheorist/index.html) website, you'll notice many similariities between our projects. This project has a larger scope and intends to supplment a full course at a standard university, or get very close to replacing the course. For more detailed documentation regarding this, please see our [FAQ]() detailing our process for the publications and reviews.

Each Section corresponds to a different academic field. There are current Work in Progress for each S.T.E.M. field we are working on. There is one full LaTeX publication that is frequently updated once new publications are completed. Please read our Wiki and FAQ before begniing to contribute to the project, or searching through our publications. 

If you'd like the help the project [please contact the admins]().
