Hello! Welcome to the Repository for the Bibliographies Project!

This project is designed for creating in-depth and quality assured documents, publications and helpful guides for any person interested in learning academic disciplines, or attempting an academic degree. It is an open source project that allows individuals to freely fork the project as per our lisence. 

This entire is a *rolling* work in progress. If you find an error, please either comment or pull/fix the issue. This project was a private repo for a large amount of time, and there are two repos, one private for our current [GitBook publication](https://app.gitbook.com/@bibliographies-project/s/bibliographies-project/) as those changes disturb how our repo is set up. A [public repo](https://github.com/BibliographiesProject/Bibliographies) for all our staging and future changes with the ability to download the entire project as a package for local storage and archival needs.

## Where to find us (in order of updates)

There are three places in order to find our project:

[GitHub](https://github.com/BibliographiesProject/Bibliographies)

 * The place where our repository is hosted. You're able to fork the project, download as a package, leave comments and create new documents for the admins to check.


[GitBook](https://app.gitbook.com/@bibliographies-project/s/bibliographies-project/)

 * If you don't care about downloading the project/forking it, leaving comments or contributing (nothing wrong with that!), GitBook is the better version of our Reddit site (subreddit). It's a better end user experience, and allows us to pull analytics of our individual publications, and site. GitBook is hooked to the private Repo of the project, and is 1:1 cloned with the repository after changes are made and approved.


[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/bibliographies/)

 * Please use desktop Reddit, as well as only using [old reddit](https://old.reddit.com/r/bibliographies/). Material is loaded faster, as well as having the proper CSS in order to allow "clean" user experience. There are no hooks, and everything is manually updated after changes are made to the repo and site. This is still updated due to having collaborations with other subreddits, moderators, and communities and is a great marketing tool for the project. Publications are 1:1 synced with our repo after 2 months (updates every 6 months on old projects). New publications are released in batches. 

[Discord](https://discord.gg/PYZkaBUSFQ)

* You're able to meet with members of the coummnity, be in the know with the newest changes and long term updates and see how the project is coming along, as well as seeing who we collaborate with. 

## What this project is about

If you've ever visited Gerard T'Hoofts [How to become a a GOOD Theoretical Physicist](https://webspace.science.uu.nl/~gadda001/goodtheorist/index.html) website, you'll notice many similariities between our projects. This project has a larger scope and intends to supplment a full course at a standard university, or get very close to replacing the course. For more detailed documentation regarding this, please see our [FAQ]() detailing our process for the publications and reviews.

Each Section corresponds to a different academic field. There are current Work in Progress for each S.T.E.M. field we are working on. There is one full LaTeX publication that is frequently updated once new publications are completed. Please read our Wiki and FAQ before begniing to contribute to the project, or searching through our publications.
