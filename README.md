# The Bibliographies Project

Hello! Welcome to the Repository for the Bibliographies Project! <br />

This project is designed for creating in-depth and quality assured documents, publications and helpful guides for any person interested in learning academic disciplines, or attempting an academic degree. 

If you've ever visited Gerard T'Hoofts [How to become a a GOOD Theoretical Physicist](https://webspace.science.uu.nl/~gadda001/goodtheorist/index.html) website, you'll notice many similariities between our projects. This project has a larger scope and intends to supplment a full course at a standard university, or get very close to replacing the course. For more detailed documentation regarding this, please see our [FAQ]() detailing our process for the publications and reviews. 

If you'd like the help the project [please contact the admins]().

There are current Work in Progress for each S.T.E.M. field we are working on. <br />
There are also full published Main Documents relating to each field and one Master LaTeX bibliography.<br />
<br />
Mathematics Repository is currently out of focus<br />
