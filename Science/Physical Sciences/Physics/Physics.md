# Physics

Physics is the study of matter and energy, and seeks to understand how the universe works at its most fundamental level.  The goal of physics is to come up with mathematical rules that can accurately predict and explain all of the various phenomena of our universe.

**Prerequisites:**

Studying physics at the high-school or conceptual level requires a good understanding of basic math and algebra.  University-level physics requires calculus, since the mathematical laws of physics involve instantaneous rates of change.  Readers who wish to learn physics at this level must understand limits, derivatives, and integrals, and should eventually study linear algebra, multivariable calculus, and differential equations after moving on to more advanced subtopics.

**Where to Start:**

Readers who wish to start learning physics should begin by obtaining an introductory textbook, which will typically cover basic mechanics, electricity and magnetism, and a few selected topics in modern physics.  Introductory textbooks can be roughly divided by depth and difficulty into high-school, conceptual (algebra-based), and university (calculus-based) levels.  Readers who are familiar with elementary calculus should start with a university-level text.  Those wishing to make a serious study of physics should first learn calculus and then study a university-level text.  It is very important to study the chosen textbook methodically, chapter-by-chapter, and it is especially important to solve the problems found at the end of each section.  There is no substitute for solving many problems on your own when it comes to understanding physics.

You may wish to supplement your textbook reading with conceptual readings (like the Feynman lectures on Physics) and lectures appropriate to your level.  These may help you think about your reading, but cannot replace studying a textbook deeply and solving physics problems.  Once you finish the introductory text, you should be ready to move on to specialized subtopics - start with a more in-depth study of classical mechanics.
