# Quantum Mechanics

Quantum mechanics is the branch of physics that explains how the universe works at distances comparable to or smaller than the atom.  Various observations made in the late 19^th and early 20^th centuries made it clear that physics at this distance scale cannot be described by ordinary classical physics.  For example, in 1905 Albert Einstein explained an unusual aspect of the photoelectric effect (the effect behind the workings of solar cells): low-intensity, short-wavelength light was capable of knocking electrons out of a semiconductor material while high-intensity, long-wavelength light would not generate current in the material.  Einstein realized that the light must contain energy "quanta" that would interact individually with electrons in the material, which was not consistent with the classical conception of light as a continuous wave that would gradually supply enough energy for these electrons to escape.

Quantum mechanics was developed to explain these strange phenomena of tiny things.  It describes the dynamics of particles using quantized wavefunctions and expresses their observable values in terms of probabilities.  Yet, amazingly, it still "corresponds" to classical mechanics at larger distances - it extends, but does not replace, our classical physics.

**Prerequisites:**

Readers should complete a study of general physics and classical mechanics before beginning work on quantum mechanics.  In terms of mathematical experience, readers should be familiar with elementary calculus, linear algebra, and how to solve ordinary differential equations.  For the more advanced standard problems, multivariable calculus and familiarity with solving partial differential equations will also be required, and a basic knowledge of electrodynamics will also be helpful.

**Where to Start:**

Readers should begin by obtaining an introductory quantum mechanics textbook - for the beginner, Griffiths' text is probably the best choice.  It is important to study each chapter in depth and work as many problems as possible at the end of each section.  The core of a basic introduction to quantum physics is a study of canonical problems - free particles, potential wells, harmonic oscillators, and the Coulomb potential - readers should eventually be able to compute the basis wavefunctions for each of these standard potentials.  And, just as with every other subtopic in physics, understanding is gradually developed as you solve many problems.  After completing Griffiths, readers can move on to graduate-level texts like Shankar.

By the time you finish your initial study of quantum mechanics, you should understand the correspondence between the laws of classical and quantum mechanics, understand that Schrodinger's equation allows a derivation of the energy basis for wavefunctions, understand the time-dependence of wavefunctions, be able to compute expectation values for observable quantities, be able to find the energy levels and wavefunctions for basic potentials like the infinite square well, understand the quantum harmonic oscillator and ladder operators, understand how to compute the electron energy levels in the Hydrogen atom, and be able to use perturbative methods to study small changes in quantum systems.  Many of these concepts, particularly the harmonic oscillator and perturbation theory, are extremely important in more advanced quantum theory.

Quantum mechanics is just the first step in understanding how the universe works at very small scales and how our macroscopic world can be an emergent feature of the universe's most fundamental physics.  It was quickly realized that ordinary quantum mechanics is incompatible with special relativity (it cannot describe the very small *and* the very fast).  Quantum field theory developed from the need for a quantum theory that is consistent with special relativity and can describe processes in which particles are created or destroyed (as observed from radioactive decay or inelastic scattering within particle colliders).  The next steps in understanding the most fundamental theories of physics are to study particle physics and quantum field theory, although this will require significant additional mathematical knowledge (e.g. complex analysis).
