 # Math Methods for Physicists
 
 **Preliminary:**

Math methods is completely different than Mathematical Physics. Do not confuse either subject/field. Math Methods is not a field of physics, rather a field of internal instruction for physics majors.

Math Methods bridges the gap between Multivariable Calculus/Linear Algebra/Ordinary Differential Equations to complex mathematical areas which Physics Majors need to be fluent in, but not masters in. For example, most Physicists and/or majors do not need to be proficient in most areas of Real Analysis, Group Theory or Probability and Statistics. Some proficiency is required, but not to the level as Mathematicians and/or majors would need to be at. Math Methods essentially covers these areas to the degree of which you may require and not much afterwards.

In simple plain English, Math Methods takes out the bullshit and fluff that physicists don't require in their Mathematics.

**Prerequisites:**

* [Multivariable Calculus](https://old.reddit.com/r/bibliographies/comments/ak9let/multivariable_calculus/)

* [Linear Algebra](https://old.reddit.com/r/bibliographies/comments/akgoky/linear_algebra/)

* [Ordinary Differential Equations](https://old.reddit.com/r/bibliographies/comments/akgt8r/differential_equations/)

**Books:**

* [Mathematical Methods for Physicists: A Comprehensive Guide 7th Edition by George B. Arfken, Hans J. Weber, Frank E. Harris](https://www.amazon.com/Mathematical-Methods-Physicists-Comprehensive-Guide/dp/0123846544) *Covers Mathematics at the Graduate Level, does not do any area particularly in depth, but covers many areas widely and does it well. I personally used this textbook as I prefer it to Boas.*

* [Mathematical Methods in the Physical Sciences 3rd Edition by Mary L. Boas](https://www.amazon.com/Mathematical-Methods-Physical-Sciences-Mary/dp/0471198269) *Most students find this a confusing bout the first time around. Looking back at it in your grad years, you'll find this a very good reference. Not good to teach yourself from as Boas makes jumps in explanations which aren't as clear learning through the first time.*

* [Mathematical Methods for Physics and Engineering: A Comprehensive Guide 3rd Edition by K. F. Riley (Author), M. P. Hobson (Author), S. J. Bence (Author)](https://archive.org/details/MathematicalMethodsForPhysicsAndEngineering/page/n4/mode/2up) *A book I've seen recommended across forums. An easier version of Boas and Arfken which is more hand-holdey and seems to be "just alright"*

* [Basic Training in Mathematics: A Fitness Program for Science Students by R. Shankar (Author)](https://www.amazon.com/Basic-Training-Mathematics-Fitness-Students/dp/0306450364) *A book I've seen sometimes referenced due to the popularity of it's predecessor, though it doesn't cover as much material as Arfken or Boas. More like a bridge between simple engineering mathematics and physics mathematics.*

* [Carl Bender PSI Lectures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYNOGk3ZjFM&list=PL_LAJKOptm3ZWZHVNr8FmMzsWgb989ltu) *Refers to the class as Mathematical Physics, though it is Mathematical Methods*#
