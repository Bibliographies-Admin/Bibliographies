# Classical Mechanics

Classical mechanics is the oldest subtopic within physics; it contains the ideas first discovered at the turn of the 17th century by Sir Isaac Newton, the father of modern physics.  Classical mechanics is the study of the motion of "everyday things" - its goal is to use mathematical rules to predict the behavior of ordinary objects when acted upon by forces.

**Prerequisites:**

* [General Physics](/Science/Physical-Sciences/Physics/Physics.md)

* [Multivariable Calculus](/Math/MultivariableCalculus.md)

* [Ordinary Differential Equations](/Math/Differential-Equations.md)


**Where to Start:**

Readers should start with a standard classical mechanics text, reading each chapter methodically and solving the problems found at the end of each chapter.  As with general physics, there is no substitute for solving lots of problems - this is the only way to truly understand classical mechanics.  Textbooks can be divided into undergraduate- and graduate-level; readers should start with undergraduate texts before attempting the more advanced works on the subject.  *Those who are self-studying and have just completed general physics should start by studying Taylor's book.*

The study of classical mechanics begins with a review of Newtonian methods and concepts but at a deeper level, with new techniques and in more general or complex situations.  Eventually readers will study the calculus of variations, a very important technique that makes new types of calculations possible and is very important in more advanced topics.  Most basic texts will also have introductory sections on special relativity, in which you will discover that our principles of classical mechanics are only low-velocity approximations of the more general and far stranger rules of relativistic motion.  Readers may wish to continue on to a more modern treatment of classical mechanics, which will require an understanding of differential geometry.

After completing a study of classical mechanics, readers trying to obtain a basic education in physics should move on to electrodynamics (which will require an understanding of multivariable calculus and vector calculus) or quantum mechanics (which requires linear algebra and, for some topics, multivariable calculus).  It will become increasingly important to improve your knowledge of mathematical methods as you progress into more advanced subtopics.
