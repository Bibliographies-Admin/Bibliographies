# Special relativity

"Special Relativity is the generally accepted and experimentally confirmed physical theory regarding the relationship between space and time."

**Prerequisites:**

Depending on the book:

- [Multivariable Calculus](/Math/MultivariableCalculus.md)

- [Linear Algebra](/Math/LinearAlgebra.md)

**Books**

* [  French, A. P. (2017). *Special Relativity*. CRC Press.](https://www.amazon.com/Special-Relativity-M-I-T-Introductory-Physics/dp/0393097935)
  *  ISBN-13 ‏ : ‎ 978-0393097931 

* [Special Relativity First Edition by Robert Resnick](https://www.amazon.com/Special-Relativity-P-Robert-Resnick/dp/0471717258)

* [The Meaning of Relativity by Albert Einstein](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/36276/36276-pdf.pdf) *Helps make a connection between Special Relativity and General Relativity. A "mathy" introduction to Special Relativity compared to most books, requires a good grasp on Calculus and possibly of Linear Algebra*

* [SPECIAL RELATIVITY AND ITS EXPERIMENTAL FOUNDATION (Advanced Theoretical Physical Science) by Yuan Zhong Zhang](https://www.amazon.com/RELATIVITY-EXPERIMENTAL-FOUNDATION-Advanced-Theoretical/dp/9810227493) *An interesting read if you need to know the experimental basis of Special Relativity*

* [Special Relativity: An Introduction with 200 Problems and Solutions 2010th Edition by Michael Tsamparlis](https://www.amazon.com/Special-Relativity-Introduction-Problems-Solutions/dp/3642038360)
