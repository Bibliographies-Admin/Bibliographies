# Basic Algebra

Basic (or elementary) algebra extends arithmetic by introducing symbols known as variables that do not represent a specific number but any number to be inserted later.   The goal of algebra is to manipulate expressions that involve these variables in order to study general relationships.  For example, the equation "A = lw" can be used to express that the area of *any* rectangle is equal to its length times its width - replacing "l" and "w" with specific measurements will find the area of an actual rectangle. Using algebra, this equation can be changed into "l = A/w", which tells us that the length of any rectangle is equal to its area divided by its width.  The ability to easily manipulate algebraic equations in a variety of ways is essential to studying more complex mathematical techniques.

Basic algebra should be distinguished from "algebra" in general, which is a branch of mathematics that manipulates symbols in the context of more complex structures with different properties than ordinary numbers; this more advanced field is sometimes called modern (or abstract) algebra.

**Prerequisites:**

Readers who wish to study basic algebra must have mastered arithmetic.  They should have the basic mathematical facts (one-digit addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) memorized.  If these have not been memorized, readers should practice these math facts using flashcards until they can be recited automatically.  The most common reason for difficulty in learning algebra is not having a sufficiently strong foundation in basic arithmetic.

**Where to Start:**

Readers should obtain a mathematically-rigorous introductory textbook appropriate to their current level.  Textbooks must be read chapter-by-chapter, and it is extremely important to work as many problems found in this text as possible.  Just as you can only achieve fluency in a language by speaking it frequently, you can only achieve proficiency in algebra by using it to solve a large number of problems.  It may be helpful to purchase additional textbooks that provide additional problems or alternative explanations; there are also online tutorials and videos that might be helpful.

By the end of a study of basic algebra, it is very important that readers be able to manipulate algebraic expressions and equations with fluency.   Readers who go on to study higher math will have to simplify and solve algebraic equations while applying more complex techniques, and unless it is second nature, readers will struggle with the algebra instead of learning the new techniques.

After mastering algebra, the next goal is calculus, which is the mathematical foundation of science and its laws.  It is possible to go from algebra directly into calculus, but readers may benefit from studying precalculus first - the idea behind this is to cover important topics in trigonometry and analytic geometry beforehand so that students can focus exclusively on the calculus.  Going on to study calculus will enable readers to begin learning the physical sciences and engineering.
