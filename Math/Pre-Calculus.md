#Pre-Calculus#

Precalculus encompasses mathematical knowledge useful to those who have taken high school algebra and are preparing to learn university-level calculus.  Although readers who have taken algebra *can* move straight into calculus, it is recommended to learn the important background topics from precalculus ahead of time so that readers can focus exclusively on the concepts of calculus.  The topics that should be studied in precalculus course can be grouped into three subjects: algebra, trigonometry, and analytic geometry (which should cover the definition of a function).

**Prerequisites:**

Readers should have a solid grasp of arithmetic before attempting to prepare for calculus.  It is very important to have basic arithmetic facts memorized - if you struggle with arithmetic, you'll struggle with algebra.  If you struggle with algebra, you'll struggle with calculus and so on until you decide that you are someone who is "not good at math".  But there are no people who are inherently bad at math, only those who lack sufficient preparation.  If you don't have the arithmetic tables memorized, it is very important to get a deck of flashcards and practice until they're automatic.

Readers should also have a basic familiarity with algebra.  You should understand the basic rules of algebra and be able to manipulate equations, but may still need to write down every step in solving an equation.  Algebra should be practiced diligently alongside the newer topics in trigonometry and analytic geometry.  By the time you finish precalculus, you should be able to do algebra quickly and easily.

**Where to Start:**

Readers should obtain a precalculus textbook and work through each of the important topics chapter-by-chapter, solving as many problems as possible at the end of each section.  As these books can be pricy, readers may want to purchase older editions, which will be far less expensive.  A good preparation for calculus involves three topics - algebra, trigonometry, and analytic geometry.  Standard precalculus texts do not focus on algebra, so if more practice with algebra is needed, it is recommended that you also pick up a supplementary text (see also the [basic algebra bibliography](http://www.reddit.com/r/bibliographies/comments/36ltzk/math_basic_algebra/)).  Readers who are new to mathematics may find some textbook explanations difficult - use supplemental videos and online materials to get additional information on topics you find difficult.  But as with any mathematical technique, the only way to learn is by solving many problems - be sure to work as many problems as possible from your textbook.

*More than anything else, the key to getting prepared for a college-level calculus is being able to manipulate algebraic expressions with fluency.*   Readers who struggle with symbols and equations, won't be focused on learning the underlying concepts in calculus.  So it is very important to be *comfortable* with algebra before starting calculus.  And the only way to do this is to practice algebra correctly - play with the algebra - until it feels natural.  You should be able to look at equations like "2/3 x - 9 = 5" and see how these numbers move from one side to the other to end up with "x = 21".  Practice your algebra diligently and you will set yourself up for success in calculus.

Trigonometry is encountered in calculus primarily because of its importance in physics and higher math - it is not essential to the concepts of elementary calculus, but will be encountered in problems and examples.  Readers should understand what trigonometric ratios are and be able to explain what sine, cosine, and tangent mean using a right triangle inscribed within a unit circle.  It will also be helpful to learn how to simplify trigonometric expressions using the most important identities.

In basic Algebraic Geometry, algebraic equations are studied by graphing them in the Cartesian coordinate system.  Readers should at least learn the definition of a function, how to graph a function, how to interpret and work with graphs, and the functions associated with the conic sections (e.g. the parabola).  There are a standard set of graphs and functions used in calculus as examples such as parabolas, hyperbolas, and the trigonometric functions, and readers should become familiar enough with these to be able to draw them on a graph from their algebraic form.

#Proof Techniques#

Proof is essential to the structure of mathematics; it provides mathematical statements with a certainty that is impossible in virtually every other field of intellectual inquiry.  A valid proof provides an absolute link between established axioms and truths of mathematics and a new piece of mathematical knowledge known as a theorem.  Proficiency with these techniques is a prerequisite to the study of higher mathematics.  This bibliography covers the basic methods that are used to contruct a proof of a theorem, while proof theory, computer-assisted proof, and other topics in mathematical logic are outside its scope.

**Prerequisites:**

Readers can study methods of proof without any prior knowledge.  However, familiarity with basic propositional and first order logic may be helpful, since proofs are essentially informal arguments with an underlying formal logical structure.  For example, one of the basic proof techniques is proving the contrapositive rather than the original statement of a theorem, and readers who have studied logic will immediately understand why the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the conditional statement itself.   Many introductory proof textbooks will contain these aspects of formal logic, so a separate study is not strictly necessary.

It is difficult to demonstrate the methods of proof without having something to prove, and so different introductory texts will typically assume (or explain) some background mathematical knowledge.  Readers should check that the sources they use do not assume too much knowledge beyond their current level; however this will not usually pose an insurmountable problem for those familiar with elementary mathematics and algebra.

**Where to Start:**

Readers wanting to learn how to construct proofs should obtain an introductory textbook.  Proof techniques should be learned in two steps: first understand how the strategy works, then use that technique to  prove simple mathematical statements until the proof strategy becomes second nature.  For example, to understand proof by contradiction you must first understand the idea behind the technique - statements can only be true or false, so if you can demonstrate that it is impossible for a statement to be false by deriving a contradicton, then the statement must be true - then practice it by proving statements; the classic example of proof by contradiction is the proof that the square root of two is irrational: if you assume that the square root of two is a reduced fraction a/b, you can show that a,b must have the factor 2 in common, which contradicts the assumption that a/b is a reduced fraction, and therefore the square root of two must be irrational.  Choose many simple mathematical statements and practice using each strategy several times.

Readers who complete a study of proof methods should understand the conditional structure of theorems, understand how to write concise proofs, and know the following proof methods: direct proof, proof by contradiction, proving the contrapositive, proof by exhaustion (cases), existence and uniqueness proofs, universal and existential quantifiers and counterexamples, proving biconditional statements, and mathematical induction.  After completing this study, readers will be prepared to study formal mathematics, although it is advisible to study basic math through elementary calculus before beginning work on pure mathematics.  Good places to start are real analysis, discrete mathematics, or number theory.
