#Topology#

#**Brief Explanation**

In mathematics, topology is concerned with the properties of space that are preserved under continuous deformations, such as stretching, twisting, crumpling and bending, but not tearing or gluing. An n-dimensional topological space is a space with certain properties of connectedness and compactness. - Wikipedia
