#Partial Differential Equations#

In mathematics, a partial differential equation is a differential equation that contains beforehand unknown multivariable functions and their partial derivatives. PDEs are used to formulate problems involving functions of several variables, and are either solved by hand, or used to create a computer model. -Wikipedia
