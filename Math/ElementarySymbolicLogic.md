#elementary symbolic logic#

This bibliography covers the basics of symbolic logic - the study of formal reasoning through the manipulation of symbols, a topic that includes propositional logic (involving the logical relationships between atomic statements) and first-order predicate logic (which extends this analysis to statements broken down into atomic subjects, predicates, quantifiers, and variable subjects).  The study of symbolic logic provides insight into logical fallacies, mathematical proof, and boolean logic, among other scientific and mathematical topics.  Higher-order, non-classical, and informal logics are beyond the scope of this bibliography.

**Prerequisites:**

No prerequisite knowledge is necessary to study symbolic logic.  Introductory texts will start from the most basic definitions and truth tables for logical operators, so previous experience with logic is not required.

**Where to Start:**

Readers who wish to learn symbolic logic should obtain an elementary textbook. A good text should begin with the basic ideas of propositional logic - that atomic statements can be either true or false, and that truth tables define the operators "and", "or", "not", "if...then", and "if and only if" that combine these atomic statements to express logical relationships.  Truth tables involving combinations of statements can be used to demonstrate the logical equivalence of different statements (e.g. "not A and B" is the same as "not-A or not-B"). The resulting logical rules can be used to build arguments - from a set of atomic and complex statements, a valid proof will show that a conclusion must necessarily follow.  Truth table analysis will also identify logical fallacies, arguments that appear to be proper but are logically invalid.  A classic example is the following: "if it is raining, then the sidewalk is wet" and "the sidewalk is wet" does not imply "it is raining" - this fallacy is known as *affirming the consequent*.  Simple intuition tells us that this form is invalid because the sidewalk could be wet for some other reason, and a truth table will verify that these two statements do not imply the conclusion.

After a survey of propositional logic, readers should continue on to study first-order predicate logic.  Predicate logic divides atomic statements into subject and predicate; "Spot is a dog" might be represented by "s" in propositional logic, but might be represented by "Ds" in predicate logic, where "D" is the predicate "____ is a dog" and "s" represents the individual constant "Spot".  This allows the representation of statements involving universal and existential quantifiers - non-specific statements that refer to either all individuals or at least one individual, respectively.  These quantifiers are particularly important in the statement of mathematical theorems.

Readers should read and study each of these topics, but it is extremely important to work many problems as well.  Create your own truth tables, try to find equivalent statements of your own, prove the validity of the basic forms of argument, show that fallacies are invalid, and construct your own arguments.  Much like mathematics, the only way to internalize the rules of symbolic logic is to practice using them.  Upon completing a study of elementary symbolic logic, readers may wish to go on to study further topics in formal logic like non-classical or higher-order logics, a broader study of logic to include informal logic, or methods of mathematical proof as preparation for a study of formal mathematics.
