# Set Theory

Set theory is a branch of mathematical logic that studies sets, which informally are collections of objects. Although any type of object can be collected into a set, set theory is applied most often to objects that are relevant to mathematics. The language of set theory can be used to define nearly all mathematical objects.

**Prerequisites:**

Since set theory is a fundamental topic it doesn’t require any specific prerequisites. But, some mathematical maturity in the reader is needed to appreciate the relevance of some of the definitions and theorems. Depending on the set theory course, you may need first a course where you learn to write proofs. Or, that may be the emphasis of the set theory course itself.

**Where to Start:**

Readers who want to learn set theory should start with an introductory text book. A list of excellent choices is presented below. But, readers should be aware that there are a lot of books that teach set theory in “naive approach”. For a more complete understanding of the subject, an “axiomatic approach” must complement the naive approach. Since set theory is a first year undergraduate course, some readers might find set theory different to topics they have faced in high school. The sudden focus on proofs on seemingly “trivial” topics might be tedious for readers, but it is necessary to understand that rigorous proofs of fundamental results ensures integrity of mathematics as a whole. Readers might find taking written notes more helpful in understanding the subject.
