# Multivariable Calculus

"Multivariable calculus (also known as multivariate calculus) is the extension of calculus in one variable to calculus with functions of several variables: the differentiation and integration of functions involving multiple variables, rather than just one." -Wikipedia

**Prerequisites:**

* [Basic Algebra](https://github.com/BibliographiesProject/Bibliographies/blob/a7db5b50a2706250e8cd3441a2d99d311884a6b6/Math/BasicAlgebra.md)

* [Precalculus](https://github.com/BibliographiesProject/Bibliographies/blob/a7db5b50a2706250e8cd3441a2d99d311884a6b6/Math/Pre-Calculus.md)

* [Methods of Proof](https://github.com/BibliographiesProject/Bibliographies/blob/a7db5b50a2706250e8cd3441a2d99d311884a6b6/Math/ProofTechniques.md)

* [Single Variable Calculus](https://github.com/BibliographiesProject/Bibliographies/blob/a7db5b50a2706250e8cd3441a2d99d311884a6b6/Math/SingleVariableCalculus.md)

**Where to Start:**

Readers who wish to study Multivariable calculus should pick a good introductory textbook and work through it chapter-by-chapter. These books tend to be very expensive, so readers may wish to choose a cheaper, older edition for self-study. It is very important to solve as many problems given in each section as possible - this is not just to test your reading; working (and sometimes struggling) with these problems is a necessary part of gaining proficiency in the techniques of calculus. Success will come with practice, and practice means solving problems.

At the end of a study of Multivariable calculus, readers should understand Limits and Continuity, Partial Differentiation, Multiple Integration, and the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus in Three Dimensions.  This will prepare the reader to go on to study the mathematical laws of the physical sciences. Readers who wish to learn mathematics in more depth may wish to study analysis next, which covers the theorems and proofs behind calculus in far more depth. However, this will require an understanding of basic logic and the techniques needed to constructing proofs.
