# Single Variable Calculus

Calculus is a set of mathematical techniques based on applying the idea of limit to functions, which makes it possible to study the rate at which a function changes at one specific instant rather than just its average rate of change over a finite period of time.  The techniques of calculus are the foundation of physical science, and so it is no coincidence that calculus and modern physics were born simultaneously through the work of Sir Isaac Newton and his contemporaries.

**Prerequisites:**

Readers who wish to learn elementary calculus must have an understanding of arithmetic and basic algebra (manipulating algebraic expressions and solving algebraic equations).  It is helpful but not necessary to be familiar with trigonometry (sine, cosine, and tangent as ratios within the unit circle and their application to geometry) and analytic geometry (parabolas, hyperbolas, conic sections, and other related functions) - these can be learned while studying the calculus.

It is important to note that *learning this topic is not nearly as difficult as its "scary" reputation might suggest*.  Do not be put off by the word "calculus" - all readers who have a good grasp of basic math and basic algebra will be able to learn its techniques.  Understanding the ideas behind the techniques will require you to solve many problems, think about the concepts,  and eventually study theorems, but anyone can learn calculus itself.  Readers should think of elementary calculus as being merely the basic grammar of science.

**Where to Start:**

Readers who wish to study calculus should pick a good introductory textbook and work through it chapter-by-chapter.  These books tend to be very expensive, so readers may wish to choose a cheaper, older edition for self-study.  It is very important to solve as many problems given in each section as possible - this is not just to test your reading; working (and sometimes struggling) with these problems is a necessary part of gaining proficiency in the techniques of calculus.  Success will come with practice, and practice means solving problems.

At the end of a study of elementary calculus, readers should understand functions, limits, continuity, derivatives, and integrals, and should also be familiar with trigonometric, exponential, and logarithmic functions as well as sequences and series.  This will prepare the reader to go on to study the mathematical laws of the physical sciences.  Readers who wish to learn mathematics in more depth may wish to study analysis next, which covers the theorems and proofs behind calculus in far more depth.  However, this will require an understanding of basic logic and the techniques needed to constructing proofs.

Readers who wish to study the physical sciences or engineering will discover that elementary calculus is only the first set of techniques they must master - the next steps are to learn multivariable calculus and differential equations.  Multivariable calculus extends the techniques of calculus to functions of many variables (for example, one can find the volume of a geometric shape by integrating over the interior of the three-dimensional figure).  This should culminate in a study of calculus applied to vector spaces, also known as vector calculus.  In the study of differential equations, readers will learn how to find functions that solve equations containing derivatives - and most of the universe's rules are written in the form of differential equations.
