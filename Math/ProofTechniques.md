# Proof Techniques

Proof is essential to the structure of mathematics; it provides mathematical statements with a certainty that is impossible in virtually every other field of intellectual inquiry.  A valid proof provides an absolute link between established axioms and truths of mathematics and a new piece of mathematical knowledge known as a theorem.  Proficiency with these techniques is a prerequisite to the study of higher mathematics.  This bibliography covers the basic methods that are used to contruct a proof of a theorem, while proof theory, computer-assisted proof, and other topics in mathematical logic are outside its scope.

**Prerequisites:**

Readers can study methods of proof without any prior knowledge.  However, familiarity with basic propositional and first order logic may be helpful, since proofs are essentially informal arguments with an underlying formal logical structure.  For example, one of the basic proof techniques is proving the contrapositive rather than the original statement of a theorem, and readers who have studied logic will immediately understand why the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the conditional statement itself.   Many introductory proof textbooks will contain these aspects of formal logic, so a separate study is not strictly necessary.

It is difficult to demonstrate the methods of proof without having something to prove, and so different introductory texts will typically assume (or explain) some background mathematical knowledge.  Readers should check that the sources they use do not assume too much knowledge beyond their current level; however this will not usually pose an insurmountable problem for those familiar with elementary mathematics and algebra.

**Where to Start:**

Readers wanting to learn how to construct proofs should obtain an introductory textbook.  Proof techniques should be learned in two steps: first understand how the strategy works, then use that technique to  prove simple mathematical statements until the proof strategy becomes second nature.  For example, to understand proof by contradiction you must first understand the idea behind the technique - statements can only be true or false, so if you can demonstrate that it is impossible for a statement to be false by deriving a contradicton, then the statement must be true - then practice it by proving statements; the classic example of proof by contradiction is the proof that the square root of two is irrational: if you assume that the square root of two is a reduced fraction a/b, you can show that a,b must have the factor 2 in common, which contradicts the assumption that a/b is a reduced fraction, and therefore the square root of two must be irrational.  Choose many simple mathematical statements and practice using each strategy several times.

Readers who complete a study of proof methods should understand the conditional structure of theorems, understand how to write concise proofs, and know the following proof methods: direct proof, proof by contradiction, proving the contrapositive, proof by exhaustion (cases), existence and uniqueness proofs, universal and existential quantifiers and counterexamples, proving biconditional statements, and mathematical induction.  After completing this study, readers will be prepared to study formal mathematics, although it is advisible to study basic math through elementary calculus before beginning work on pure mathematics.  Good places to start are real analysis, discrete mathematics, or number theory.
