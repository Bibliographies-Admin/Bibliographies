# Material to be Covered in the Future:

* Please do not heed any information down below in Material to be Covered in the Future. This is a launchpad for me to create Bibliographies on and fill out whenever I'm able to. Just because a field is not listed down below, and/or field of study, does not mean I'm not aware of/not going to do a bibliography on it. This is just information that will put me on the right track for finding material and most of the missing information will be found along the way.
