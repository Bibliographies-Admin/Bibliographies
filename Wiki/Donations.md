# What your money would be used for

If you decide to donate, your funds will only go towards one avenue as of (7/25/2021), paying for GitHub or GitBook. The current expenditures for these sites and hosting currently are 20$ a month. 

# [Monero](https://www.getmonero.org/get-started/what-is-monero/)

## Currently Monero is the only accepted donation avenue

Donating through Monero is the best option for any user to donate to the project. Follow these steps for a simple solution, and an untraceable way to donate to this project. If there is demand for other avenues of donating, I will consider finding other avenues of dontating. 

## Straight Purchase

* Go to Kraken and purchase some Monero (XMR)

* Send the Monero to your private wallet and send your swapped Monero to the public key presented below. 

## Swapping

* Download [CakeWallet](https://cakewallet.com/)

* Go to your favorite exchange and purchase some LiteCoin (this is due to low transaction fees for both you and the next swap). 

* Open CakeWallet and create two new wallets, one for LTC and one for XMR.

* Send your LTC to your LTC wallet in CakeWallet. 

* Click "swap" and swap your LTC for some Monero. Select your created XMR wallet for the destination. 

* Once the transaction is completed open your XMR wallet. Send your swapped XMR to the public key that is listed below. 

* You are now done

If you'd rather complete this process with Bitcoin (BTC) repeat these same steps.
