# Read this document first. 

The mathematics section has, "How to learn our Math", with listed pre-requisites and list of fields to study with your current objectives. This is not the same with Physics or Engineering. One student cannot "jump" around to different fields by following pre-requisites. Mathematics is a little unusual in this sense. A Mechanical Engineering student cannot jump to Nuclear Engineering and learn neutron physics as simply as they could learn their thermodynamics course. Some information is learned in other fields of simultaneous study, and in this section different fields of study will be listed with their more advanced pre-requisties, more so in depth than the basic pre-requisites listed before in an individual bibliography.
